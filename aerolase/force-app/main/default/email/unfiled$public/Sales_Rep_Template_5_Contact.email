Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to follow up regarding your interest in the Aerolase Neo device for acne treatment. The Neo is a cutting-edge 1064nm laser that provides safe, effective, and fast treatment for acne, regardless of skin type.

Hereâ€™s what makes Aerolase Neo stand out for acne treatment:

ðŸŒŸNon-Invasive & Comfortable: The Neo uses a gentle laser to target acne-causing bacteria, reduce inflammation, and shrink sebaceous glandsâ€”all without discomfort or downtime.

ðŸŒŸSuitable for All Skin Types: Unlike other lasers, the Neoâ€™s technology is safe for all skin types, including darker skin tones, making it an excellent option for a diverse range of patients.

ðŸŒŸFast & Convenient: With treatments taking just 15-30 minutes, patients can fit sessions into their busy schedules. Plus, noticeable improvements in acne can often be seen in just a few sessions.

ðŸŒŸNo Consumables Required: The Neo Eliteâ€™s design eliminates the need for expensive consumables, making it a cost-effective option for your practice with no ongoing material costs.

Iâ€™d be happy to provide additional information or answer any questions you may have about the Aerolase Neoâ€™s technology, clinical results, and how it can benefit your practice. If you're available, we can schedule a demo or a call to discuss the device in more detail.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
